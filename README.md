# Amyn J. ISP petri-dish
The program that I have be designing is a “Petri Dish” program. Coded in Processing- an IDE based off JAVA, this program employs Object Oriented Programming (OOP) to create various shapes (ellipses) that show movement/bouncing within a confined area (in this case, a larger static ellipse). The larger static ellipse represents the container that is comparable to a petri dish itself, whereas the tiny circles represent molecules- allowing this assignment to mimic objects in reality while providing an exposure to programming elements. 

I'm currently in the process of transferring the code to other JAVA-related mediums, but for now, I ask that you download Processing to check my project out!

You can do so here: https://processing.org/download/
