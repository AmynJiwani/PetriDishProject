# Amyn J.- ISP petri-dish

The program that I have designed is a “Petri Dish” program. Coded in Processing- an IDE based off JAVA, this program employs Object Oriented Programming (OOP) to create various shapes (ellipses) that show movement by bouncing within a confined area (in this case, a larger static ellipse). The larger static ellipse represents the container that is comparable to a petri dish itself, whereas the tiny circles represent molecules- allowing this assignment to mimic objects in reality while providing an exposure to programming elements. 

I'm currently in the process of transferring the code to a JAVA-related medium, but for now, if you would like to see my project's UI, I would recommend checking the screenshot I posted, or downloading Processing to check my project out (if you wish to take the extra step)!
